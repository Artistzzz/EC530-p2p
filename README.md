 - Overview of the Peer-to-Peer Chat System

The peer-to-peer chat system consists of two main components in separate Python files:
chatDB.py: Manages the database operations using SQLAlchemy. It handles user data (usernames and IP addresses) and messaging data (message content, sender, and recipient details).
p2pChat.py: Manages the application logic, including a GUI, networking for message exchange, and encryption for secure communication.
